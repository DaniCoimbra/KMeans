# KMeans
This project focuses on the implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm using Python. The project aims to determine the optimal value of k, which represents the number of clusters, for a given dataset. It utilizes the scikit-learn library, which provides efficient tools for clustering and data analysis, including the k-means algorithm. It also utilizes visualization libraries, like seaborn and matplotlib.
K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning technique used for grouping similar data points into clusters. The algorithm works by iteratively assigning each data point to the nearest cluster centroid and then recalculating the centroids based on the newly formed clusters. The process continues until convergence, where the assignments and centroids no longer change significantly. By varying the value of k, the algorithm generates different cluster configurations, and the optimal k value can be determined based on calculating the silhouette score.
